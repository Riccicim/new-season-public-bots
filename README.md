<p align="center"> <b>NEW SEASON BOTS</b></p>

*The bots I share on this profile include various systems such as **moderation, statistics, protection, and web panel** — all of which are fully open-source projects.*
*My goal is to develop efficient, scalable, and secure systems for Discord communities while also contributing to the open-source ecosystem.*
